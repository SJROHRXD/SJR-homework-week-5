GIVEN I am using a **daily planner** to create a schedule, WHEN I open the planner, THEN the **current day** is displayed at the **top of the calendar**

WHEN I scroll down, THEN I am presented with **timeblocks** for _standard business hours_

WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day, THEN each timeblock is **color coded** to indicate whether it is in the _past, present, or future_

WHEN I _click into a timeblock_, THEN I can enter an **event**

WHEN I click the **save button** for that timeblock, THEN the _**text for that event is saved in local storage**_
